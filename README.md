Hey! I'm **Ash**. I'm an Internet Creative Person from the Netherlands. Here's some of my work!

	<summary>ðŸ’» I'm developing <b>SFLT</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b>SFLT</b> is a new SoundFont sampler and synthesizer plugin, available on Windows as VST3, CLAP, and as a native FL Studio plugin.<br>
	<br>
	Although still in public beta, you can get it on <a href="https://estrobiologist.gumroad.io/l/sflt">Gumroad</a>!<br>

	<summary>â­• I'm making <b>CHORDIOID</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b>CHORDIOID: First Breath</b> is a short rhythm RPG experience developed by myself and a handful of friends, available for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924780/CHORDIOID_First_Breath_Demo/">Steam</a>.<br>
	<br>
	It's the first part of a bigger episodic story known collectively as <b>CHORDIOID</b> - a major passion project of mine for a number of years now... which I hope to one day, in my wildest dreams, actually finish.<br>

	<summary>ðŸ“º I'm on the <b>Vast Error Music Team</b></summary>
	<br>
	As of 2022, I'm a musician for the webcomic <a href="https://www.deconreconstruction.com/"><b>Vast Error</b></a>. I still can't quite believe it! I'm honoured and super stoked to be working with so many ridiculously talented creatives.<br>
	<br>
	You should read the comic if you haven't, it's pretty freaking cool! <i>(If you ask me, though, start with <b><a href="https://deconreconstruction.itch.io/snowbound-blood">Snowbound Blood</a></b>.)</i><br>
	<br>

<details>
	<summary>ðŸ’¬ I made <b>Pluralchum</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b><a href="https://www.github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum">Pluralchum</a></b> is a BetterDiscord plugin that provides improved integration with PluralKit, adding things like proper name and text colours to the mix.<br>
	<br>
	I made it as a "fun" learning exercise in the span of a few days, and what I learned is that people who use JavaScript regularly are terrifying.<br>
	<br>

<details>
 	<summary>ðŸŒƒ I do <b>loads of other stuff</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b>I'm always up to something!</b> Commonly described as:<br>
	<br>
	
- *"unhinged work ethic"*
- *"please get some sleep, like, ever"*
- *"pretty cool, but uses made-up quotes too much"*

I cannot <i>possibly</i> sit still. They thought giving me medication would make me chill out, but the <i><b>joke's on them</b></i>. It just gave me the ability to do the laundry in-between constantly churning out projects. <br>
	<br>
	Speaking of which, I have to go do the laundry. But you can keep track of what I'm up to on any given day via <b><a href="https://twitter.com/estroBiologist">Twitter</a></b>.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for reading! <i>-Ash</i>
