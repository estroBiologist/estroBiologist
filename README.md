Hey! I'm **Ash**. I'm an Internet Creative Person from the Netherlands. Here's some of my work!

*(Click to expand!)*
<br>
<details>
	<summary>‚≠ï I'm making <b>CHORDIOID</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b>CHORDIOID: Prelude</b> is a musical adventure game I've been working on for the past year, as the lead developer, musician, artist, designer, writer...<br>
	<br>
	It's the first part of a bigger episodic story known collectively as <b>CHORDIOID</b>, which I hope to one day, in my wildest dreams, actually finish.<br>
	<br>

<details>
	<summary>üì∫ I'm on the <b>Vast Error Music Team</b></summary>
	<br>
	As of 2022, I'm a musician for the webcomic <a href="https://www.deconreconstruction.com/"><b>Vast Error</b></a>. I still can't quite believe it! I'm honoured and super stoked to be working with so many ridiculously talented creatives.<br>
	<br>
	You should read the comic if you haven't, it's pretty freaking cool! <i>(If you ask me, though, start with <b><a href="https://deconreconstruction.itch.io/snowbound-blood">Snowbound Blood</a></b>.)</i><br>
	<br>

<details>
	<summary>‚òÄÔ∏è I make music for <b>Godfeels</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1475819">Godfeels</a></b> is a canon-divergent fan continuation of <b>Homestuck</b>, written by Sarah Zedig and co.<br>
	<br>
	I've found myself as a... quasi-official(?) musician for the project? Which I'm very grateful for. The story means a lot to me, as well as a lot of other plural folk, and being able to provide music for it is a special kind of honour.<br>
	<br>
	You can find my Godfeels discrography <b><a href="https://8reath-of-light.bandcamp.com/">here</a></b>.<br>
	<br>

<details>
	<summary>üí¨ I made <b>Pluralchum</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b><a href="https://www.github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum">Pluralchum</a></b> is a BetterDiscord plugin that provides improved integration with PluralKit, adding things like proper name and text colours to the mix.<br>
	<br>
	I made it as a "fun" learning exercise in the span of a few days, and what I learned is that people who use JavaScript regularly are fucking unhinged.<br>
	<br>
</details>

<details>
 	<summary>üåÉ I do <b>loads of other stuff</b></summary>
	<br>
	<b>I'm always up to something!</b> Commonly described as:<br>
	<br>
	
- *"unhinged work ethic"*
- *"please get some fucking sleep, like, ever"*
- *"pretty cool, but uses made-up quotes too much"*
	
I cannot <i>possibly</i> sit still. They thought giving me medication would make me chill out, but the <i><b>joke's on them</b></i>. It just made me able to do the laundry in-between constantly churning out projects. <br>
	<br>
	Speaking of which, I have to go do the laundry. But you can keep track of what I'm up to on any given day via <b><a href="https://twitter.com/estroBiologist">Twitter</a></b>.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for reading! <i>-Ash</i>
